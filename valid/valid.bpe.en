St@@ ars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen at@@ oms are merged ( or f@@ used ) together to form heav@@ ier elements .
Scientists are working to create a re@@ actor that can make energy in the same way .
This , however , is a very hard problem to sol@@ ve and will take many years before we see useful f@@ usion re@@ actors built .
The ste@@ el ne@@ ed@@ le flo@@ ats on top of the water because of surface ten@@ sion .
Sur@@ face ten@@ sion happens because the water molecules at the surface of the water are strong@@ ly attracted to each other more than they are to the air molecules above them .
The water molecules make an in@@ visible skin on the water &apos;s surface that allows things like the ne@@ ed@@ le to flo@@ at on top of the water .
The bl@@ ade on a modern ice sk@@ ate has a double edge with a con@@ cave h@@ oll@@ ow between them . The two ed@@ ges allow for a better gr@@ as@@ p of the ice , even when til@@ ted .
Because the bottom of the bl@@ ade is slightly cur@@ ved , as the bl@@ ade til@@ ts to one side or the other , the edge which is in contact with the ice also cur@@ ves .
This causes the sk@@ ater to turn . If the sk@@ ates til@@ t to the right , the sk@@ ater turns right , if the sk@@ ates til@@ t to the left , the sk@@ ater turns left .
To return to their previous energy level , they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light .
They do this by em@@ itting a tin@@ y partic@@ le of light called a &quot; phot@@ on . &quot;
Scientists call this process &quot; stim@@ ulated em@@ ission of radiation &quot; because the at@@ oms are stim@@ ulated by the bright light , causing the em@@ ission of a phot@@ on of light , and light is a type of radiation .
The next picture shows the at@@ oms em@@ itting phot@@ ons . Of course , in reality phot@@ ons are a lot smaller than those in the picture .
Ph@@ ot@@ ons are even smaller than the stu@@ ff that makes up at@@ oms !
After hundreds of hours of operation the fil@@ am@@ ent in the bul@@ b eventually bur@@ ns out and the light bul@@ b no longer works .

A tr@@ ic@@ er@@ at@@ ops &apos; teeth would have been able to cr@@ ush not only leaves but even very t@@ ough branches and roots .
Some scientists think T@@ ric@@ er@@ at@@ ops ate cy@@ c@@ ads , which are a type of plant that was common in the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous .
These plants look like a small pal@@ m tree with a c@@ rown of shar@@ p , sp@@ ik@@ y leaves .
A T@@ ric@@ er@@ at@@ ops could have used its strong be@@ ak to stri@@ p off the leaves before eating the tr@@ un@@ k .
Other scientists arg@@ ue that these plants are very po@@ is@@ on@@ ous so it is un@@ likely that any din@@ os@@ aur ate them , even though today the sl@@ oth and other animals like the par@@ ro@@ t ( a desc@@ end@@ ant of the din@@ os@@ a@@ urs ) can eat po@@ is@@ on@@ ous leaves or fruit .
How would I@@ o &apos;s grav@@ ity pul@@ l on me ? If you stood on the surface of I@@ o , you would we@@ igh less than you do on Earth .
A person who we@@ igh@@ s 200 p@@ ounds ( 9@@ 0@@ k@@ g ) on Earth would we@@ igh about 36 p@@ ounds ( 16@@ k@@ g ) on I@@ o . So the grav@@ ity , of course , pul@@ ls less on you .
The Sun doesn &apos;t have a cr@@ ust like the Earth that you can stand on . The whole Sun is made out of g@@ ases , fire , and pl@@ as@@ ma .

The ou@@ ter@@ -@@ part we see when we look at the Sun is called the phot@@ os@@ phere , which means &quot; ball of light . &quot;
About three thousand years later , in 16@@ 10 , Italian astr@@ onom@@ er Gal@@ il@@ e@@ o Gal@@ il@@ ei used a t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ e to ob@@ serve that Ven@@ us has ph@@ ases , just as the moon does .
Ph@@ ases happen because only the side of Ven@@ us ( or of the Mo@@ on ) fac@@ ing the Sun is ligh@@ ted . The ph@@ ases of Ven@@ us supported the theory of C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us that the plan@@ ets go around the Sun .
Then , a few years later in 16@@ 39 , an English astr@@ onom@@ er named Jer@@ em@@ i@@ ah Hor@@ rocks observed a tran@@ sit of Ven@@ us .

There are many the@@ ories to how Sanskrit came into existence . One of them is about an Ar@@ yan migr@@ ation from the west into India who brought their language with them .
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is compar@@ able to the Latin language spoken in Europe .
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit . After the comp@@ il@@ ation of U@@ pan@@ is@@ ha@@ ds , Sanskrit just f@@ aded due to hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y .
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language , which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages , just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish .
With the battle for France over , Germany began to get ready to inv@@ ade the island of Britain .
Germany co@@ de@@ -@@ named the attack &quot; Oper@@ ation Se@@ al@@ ion . &quot; Most of the British Army &apos;s heavy weapons and suppl@@ ies had been lost when it evac@@ uated from D@@ un@@ k@@ ir@@ k , so the army was fair@@ ly weak .
But the Royal Nav@@ y was still much strong@@ er than the German Nav@@ y ( &quot; K@@ ri@@ eg@@ smar@@ ine &quot; ) and could have destroyed any invasion fle@@ et sent across the English Chan@@ nel .
However , very few Royal Nav@@ y ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the ad@@ mir@@ als were af@@ raid they would be sun@@ k by German air attack .
L@@ et &apos;s start with an expl@@ an@@ ation about Italy &apos;s plans . Italy was mainly the &quot; little brother &quot; of Germany and Japan .
It had a we@@ aker army and a we@@ aker nav@@ y , although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war .
Italy &apos;s main goals were African countries . To capture those countries , they would need to have a tro@@ op laun@@ ching p@@ ad , so as troops could sa@@ il across the Med@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ ean Sea and inv@@ ade Africa .
For that , they had to get rid of British b@@ ases and ships in Egypt . B@@ esides those actions , Italy &apos;s batt@@ les@@ hi@@ ps were not supposed to do anything else .
Now for Japan . Japan was an island country , just like Britain .
Sub@@ mar@@ ines are ships designed to travel under@@ water , and remain there for an extended amount of time .
Sub@@ mar@@ ines were used in World War I and World War II . B@@ ack then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range .
In the beginning of the war they mostly trav@@ elled on top of the sea , but as r@@ ad@@ ar began developing and becoming more accur@@ ate the sub@@ mar@@ ines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen .
German sub@@ mar@@ ines were called U@@ -@@ Bo@@ ats . The Ger@@ m@@ ans were very good at nav@@ ig@@ ating and operating their sub@@ mar@@ ines .
Because of their success with sub@@ mar@@ ines , after the war Ger@@ m@@ ans ar@@ en &apos;t tru@@ sted to have many of them .
Y@@ es ! King T@@ ut@@ ank@@ ham@@ un , sometimes referred to as &quot; King T@@ ut &quot; or &quot; The Bo@@ y King , &quot; is one of the most well known ancient Egyp@@ tian kings in modern times .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king li@@ sts .
However , the discovery of his tomb in 19@@ 22 made him a celebr@@ ity . While many tom@@ bs of the past were rob@@ bed , this tomb was left virtu@@ ally un@@ dist@@ ur@@ bed .
Most of the items buried with T@@ ut@@ ank@@ ham@@ un have been well pres@@ erved , including thousands of ar@@ te@@ facts made from prec@@ ious met@@ als and rare stones .
The inv@@ ention of sp@@ oke whe@@ els made As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an ch@@ ari@@ ots ligh@@ ter , faster , and better prepared to ou@@ tr@@ un soldiers and other ch@@ ari@@ ots .
Ar@@ rows from their de@@ ad@@ ly cros@@ s@@ b@@ ows could pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ate the arm@@ or of riv@@ al soldiers . About 1000 B@@ .@@ C. , the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans introduced the first cav@@ alry .
A cav@@ alry is an army that figh@@ ts on hor@@ se@@ back . The s@@ add@@ le had not yet been inv@@ ented , so the As@@ sy@@ ri@@ an cav@@ alry fought on the b@@ are bac@@ ks of their horses .
We know many Greek politic@@ ians , scientists , and artists . P@@ os@@ sib@@ ly the most known person of this culture is H@@ om@@ er , the leg@@ end@@ ary bl@@ ind poet , who composed two mast@@ er@@ pieces of Greek literature : the po@@ ems I@@ li@@ ad and O@@ d@@ ys@@ sey .
S@@ oph@@ oc@@ les and Ari@@ st@@ oph@@ an@@ es are still popular play@@ w@@ rights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature .

There are var@@ ying estim@@ ates for how many people speak Hindi . It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world .
The number of native speakers v@@ aries depending on whether or not very closely related dial@@ ects are coun@@ ted .
Es@@ tim@@ ates range from 3@@ 40 million to 500 million speakers , and as many as 8@@ 00 million people can understand the language .
Hindi and Ur@@ du are similar in voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary but different in script ; in every@@ day conver@@ s@@ ations , speakers of both languages can usually understand each other .
Around the 15th century , northern E@@ st@@ onia was under great cultural influence of Germany .
Some German mon@@ ks wanted to bring God clos@@ er to the native people , so they inv@@ ented the E@@ st@@ on@@ ian liter@@ al language .
It was based on the German alp@@ ha@@ bet and one character &quot; Õ / õ &quot; was added .
As time passed , many words that were bor@@ row@@ ed from German co@@ al@@ es@@ ced . This was the beginning of en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .

L@@ earning to create inter@@ active media requires conv@@ enti@@ onal and traditional skills , as well as tools mast@@ ered in inter@@ active classes ( stor@@ y@@ bo@@ ar@@ ding , audi@@ o and video ed@@ iting , story telling , etc . )
Inter@@ active design requires that you re-@@ ass@@ ess your as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions about media production and learn to think in a non-@@ lin@@ ear ways .
Inter@@ active design requires that compon@@ ents of a project connect to each other , but also make sense as a separate enti@@ ty .
The dis@@ advantage of z@@ oo@@ m l@@ en@@ ses is that the foc@@ al compl@@ ex@@ ity and number of l@@ ens elements required to achieve a range of foc@@ al l@@ eng@@ ths is much greater than for prime l@@ en@@ ses .
This is becoming less of an issue as l@@ ens manufac@@ tur@@ ers achieve higher standards in l@@ ens production .
This has allowed z@@ oo@@ m l@@ en@@ ses to produce pictures of a quality compar@@ able to that achieved by l@@ en@@ ses with fixed foc@@ al length .
Another dis@@ advantage of z@@ oo@@ m l@@ en@@ ses is that the maximum ap@@ er@@ ture ( the speed ) of the l@@ ens is usually lower .
This makes in@@ expensive z@@ oo@@ m l@@ en@@ ses hard to use in low-@@ light conditions without a fl@@ ash .
One of the most common problems when trying to conver@@ t a movie to D@@ V@@ D form@@ at is the over@@ s@@ can .
Most t@@ elev@@ is@@ ions are made in a way to ple@@ ase the general public .
For that reason , everything you see on the TV had the borders cut , top , bottom and sides .
This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen . That is called over@@ s@@ can .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately , when you make a D@@ V@@ D , it &apos;s borders will most likely be cut too , and if the video had sub@@ titles too close to the bottom , they won &apos;t be fully shown .
The traditional medieval cast@@ le has long inspired the imagination , con@@ j@@ uring up images of j@@ ou@@ sts , ban@@ qu@@ ets and Ar@@ th@@ ur@@ ian ch@@ iv@@ alry .
Even standing am@@ id@@ st thousand year-old ruins it is easy to bring to mind the sounds and sm@@ ells of batt@@ les long gone , to almost hear the cl@@ at@@ ter of ho@@ ov@@ es on the c@@ ob@@ bles and to sm@@ ell the fear rising from the d@@ un@@ ge@@ on p@@ its .
But is our imagination based on reality ? Wh@@ y were cast@@ les built in the first place ? How were they designed and built ?
Typ@@ ical for the period , Kir@@ by Mu@@ x@@ lo@@ e C@@ ast@@ le is more of a for@@ tified house than a true cast@@ le .
Its large g@@ la@@ zed wind@@ ows and th@@ in walls would not have been able to res@@ ist a determined attack for long .
In the 14@@ 8@@ 0s , when its construction was begun by Lord H@@ ast@@ ings , the country was relatively peac@@ eful and def@@ ense was only required against small bands of ro@@ ving mar@@ a@@ ud@@ ers .
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national s@@ over@@ e@@ ign@@ ty of all European states .
The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful , and thus national governments often changed their alli@@ ances in order to maintain the balance .
The War of Spanish S@@ uc@@ c@@ ession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power .
This marked an important change , as European powers would no longer have the pre@@ text of being religious war@@ s . Thus , the Thir@@ ty Y@@ ears &apos; War would be the last war to be lab@@ eled a religious war .

Foll@@ owers pur@@ sue certain ways of living , or practices that are intended to nur@@ ture those experiences .
Mys@@ tic@@ ism can be distingu@@ ished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emph@@ asis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of con@@ sci@@ ousness , particularly those of a peac@@ eful , in@@ si@@ gh@@ t@@ ful , bl@@ is@@ s@@ ful , or even ec@@ st@@ atic character .
Sik@@ h@@ ism is a religion from the Indian sub-@@ continent . It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sec@@ t@@ arian split within the Hindu tradition .
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism though they ac@@ knowledge its Hindu roots and traditions .
Sikhs call their religion Gur@@ m@@ at , which is Punjabi for &quot; way of the gur@@ u . &quot; The gur@@ u is a fun@@ dam@@ ental asp@@ ect of all Indian religions but in Sik@@ h@@ ism has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beli@@ efs .
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nan@@ ak ( 14@@ 6@@ 9-@@ 15@@ 39 ) . There followed in succ@@ ession a further nine gur@@ us .

My@@ Sp@@ ace is the third most popular website used in the United States and has 5@@ 4 million pro@@ files currently .
These websites have g@@ ot@@ ten a lot of attention , especially in the education setting .
There are positive aspects to these websites , which include , being able to easily set@@ up a class page which can include bl@@ ogs , vide@@ os , phot@@ os , and other features .
This page can easily be acc@@ essed by providing just one web address , which makes it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trou@@ ble using the ke@@ y@@ board or with sp@@ elling .
It can be custom@@ ized to make it easy to read and also with as much or little color as des@@ ired .

It is not a learning dis@@ ability , it is a learning disorder ; it &quot; affects 3 to 5 percent of all children , perhaps as many as 2 million American children . &quot;
These children tend to get into a lot of trou@@ ble , because they &quot; eng@@ age in ri@@ sky behavi@@ ors , get into figh@@ ts , and challenge authority &quot; in order to stim@@ ulate their brain , since their brain can not be stim@@ ulated by normal methods .
As the ability to ob@@ tain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was ob@@ tained changed .
The approach to ob@@ taining information was different . No longer did pressure re@@ side within individual rec@@ all , but the ability to rec@@ all text became more of a focus .
In ess@@ ence , the Ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dis@@ sem@@ ination of knowledge .

Some people believe that experi@@ encing many arti@@ fic@@ ially in@@ duced l@@ uc@@ id dre@@ ams often enough can be very ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sting .
The main reason for this phen@@ om@@ en@@ on is the result of the l@@ uc@@ id dre@@ ams exp@@ anding the length of time between R@@ E@@ M states .
With fewer R@@ E@@ M@@ s per night , this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body rec@@ overs becomes inf@@ requ@@ ent enough to become a problem .
This is just as ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sting as if you were to w@@ ake up every tw@@ enty or thir@@ ty minutes and watch TV .
The effect is dependent on how often your brain attempts to l@@ uc@@ id@@ ly dre@@ am per night .

Per@@ haps the most common type of tourism is what most people associ@@ ate with trav@@ eling : Rec@@ re@@ ation tourism .
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their regular day@@ -@@ to@@ -day life to rela@@ x and have fun .
Be@@ aches , them@@ e parks and camp gr@@ ounds are often the most common places frequ@@ ented by recre@@ ational tourists .
If the obj@@ ective of one &apos;s visit to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism .
Tou@@ ri@@ sts may visit different land@@ marks of a particular country or they may simply op@@ t to focus on just one area .
The Col@@ on@@ ists , seeing this activity , had also called for re@@ in@@ forc@@ ements .

St@@ ar@@ k &apos;s men took positions along the f@@ ence on the north end of the Col@@ on@@ ist &apos;s position .
When low ti@@ de opened a g@@ ap along the My@@ stic River along the northeast of the pen@@ insul@@ a , they quickly extended the f@@ ence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water &apos;s edge on a small beach .
G@@ ri@@ d@@ ley or St@@ ar@@ k placed a st@@ ake about 100 feet ( 30 m ) in front of the f@@ ence and ordered that no one fire until the regul@@ ars passed it .
The American plan reli@@ ed on laun@@ ching coord@@ inated attacks from three different direc@@ tions .
General John C@@ ad@@ wal@@ der would laun@@ ch a diver@@ sion@@ ary attack against the British gar@@ ri@@ son at B@@ ord@@ ent@@ own , in order to block off any re@@ in@@ forc@@ ements .
General James E@@ wing would take 7@@ 00 mil@@ iti@@ a across the river at Tr@@ ent@@ on F@@ erry , se@@ ize the bridge over the Ass@@ un@@ p@@ ink Cre@@ ek and prevent any enem@@ y troops from escap@@ ing .
The main ass@@ a@@ ult force of 2,@@ 400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Tr@@ ent@@ on , and then split into two groups , one under Gre@@ ene and one under S@@ ul@@ li@@ van , in order to laun@@ ch a pre-@@ d@@ awn attack .
With the change from the quarter to the half mil@@ e run , speed becomes of much less importance and end@@ ur@@ ance becomes an ab@@ sol@@ ute necess@@ ity .
Of course a first-@@ class hal@@ f-@@ mil@@ er , a man who can beat two minutes , must be poss@@ essed of a fair amount of speed , but end@@ ur@@ ance must be cultiv@@ ated at all haz@@ ards .

These t@@ el@@ es@@ cop@@ es used a combination of two l@@ en@@ ses to make dist@@ ant objects appear both near@@ er and larger .
Gre@@ ed and sel@@ f@@ ish@@ ness will always be with us and it is the nature of co@@ operation that when the majority benefit there will always be more to gain in the short term by acting sel@@ f@@ ish@@ ly
H@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , most people will real@@ ise that their long term best option is to work together with others .
But , if this ever does happen probably won &apos;t happen for a very long time . The stars are so spread out that there are tr@@ il@@ lions of miles between stars that are &quot; neigh@@ b@@ ors . &quot;
May@@ be one day , your great grand@@ children will be standing at@@ op an ali@@ en world won@@ der@@ ing about their ancient ancest@@ ors ?
Anim@@ als are made of many cells . They eat things and di@@ gest them inside . Most animals can move .
Only animals have br@@ ains ( though not even all animals do ; j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , for example , do not have br@@ ains ) .
Anim@@ als are found all over the earth . They di@@ g in the ground , sw@@ im in the oc@@ e@@ ans , and fly in the sky .
A cell is the small@@ est struc@@ tural and func@@ tional unit of a living ( things ) organ@@ ism .
C@@ ell comes from the Latin word cell@@ a which means small room .
If you look at living things under a micro@@ sc@@ ope , you will see that they are made of small s@@ quar@@ es or balls .
Rob@@ ert H@@ oo@@ ke , a bi@@ olog@@ ist from England , saw small s@@ quar@@ es in cor@@ k with a micro@@ sc@@ ope .
They looked like rooms . He was the first person to ob@@ serve dead cells
El@@ ements and comp@@ ounds can move from one state to another and not change .
N@@ it@@ ro@@ gen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen . The liquid state is den@@ s@@ er but the molecules are still the same .
Water is another example . The comp@@ ound water is made up of two hydrogen at@@ oms and one oxygen at@@ om .
It has the same molec@@ ular structure whether it is a gas , liquid , or solid .
Although its physical state may change , its chemical state remains the same .
Tim@@ e is something that is all around us , and affects everything we do , yet is difficult to understand .
Tim@@ e has been studied by religious , philosoph@@ ical , and scientific scholars for thousands of years .
We experience time as a series of events passing from the future through the present to the past .
Tim@@ e is also how we comp@@ are the dur@@ ation ( length ) of events .
You can mark the passing of time yourself by observ@@ ing the repe@@ ti@@ tion of a cycl@@ ical event . A cycl@@ ical event is something that happens again and again regularly .
Comp@@ uters today are used to man@@ ip@@ ulate pictures and vide@@ os .
S@@ oph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated anim@@ ations can be constructed on computers , and this kind of anim@@ ation is incre@@ as@@ ingly being used in television and films .
Music is often recorded using s@@ oph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated computers to process and mi@@ x sounds together .
For a long time during the nin@@ et@@ e@@ enth and tw@@ enti@@ eth centuries , it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Ma@@ ori people , who hun@@ ted gi@@ ant birds called mo@@ as .
The theory then established the idea that the Ma@@ ori people migr@@ ated from Pol@@ yn@@ es@@ ia in a Great F@@ le@@ et and took New Zealand from the Mor@@ i@@ ori , establ@@ ishing an agricultural society .
However , new evidence suggests that the Mor@@ i@@ ori were a group of main@@ land Ma@@ ori who migr@@ ated from New Zealand to the Cha@@ th@@ am Islands , developing their own distinc@@ tive , peac@@ eful culture .
There was also another tribe on the Cha@@ th@@ am islands these were Ma@@ ori who migr@@ ated away from New Zealand .
They called themselves the Mor@@ i@@ ori there were a few sk@@ ir@@ m@@ ishes and in the end , the Mor@@ i@@ ori were w@@ ip@@ ed out
Indi@@ v@@ id@@ uals who had been involved for several decades helped us appreci@@ ate our streng@@ ths and p@@ assi@@ ons while candi@@ dly ass@@ essing difficul@@ ties and even fail@@ ures .
While list@@ ening to individuals share their individual , family , and organiz@@ ational stories , we gained val@@ u@@ able in@@ sight into the past and some of the person@@ alities who influenced for good or ill the culture of the organization .
While understanding one &apos;s history does not as@@ su@@ me understanding of culture , it does at least help people gain a sense of where they fall within the history of the organization .
While ass@@ essing the success@@ es and becoming aware of fail@@ ures , individuals and the whole of the particip@@ ating persons disc@@ over more de@@ e@@ ply the values , mission , and driving forces of the organization .
In this instance , rec@@ all@@ ing previous inst@@ ances of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ ene@@ ur@@ ial behavior and resulting success@@ es helped people to be open to new changes and new direction for the local church .
Such success stories less@@ ened the f@@ ears of change , while creating positive in@@ cl@@ inations toward change in the future .
Con@@ ver@@ g@@ ent thinking patter@@ ns are problem sol@@ ving techniques that un@@ ite different ideas or fields to find a solution .
The focus of this min@@ d@@ set is speed , log@@ ic and accur@@ acy , also identi@@ fication of facts , re@@ appl@@ ying existing techniques , gath@@ ering information .
The most important factor of this min@@ d@@ set is : there is only one correct answ@@ er . You only think of two answ@@ ers , nam@@ ely right or wrong .
This type of thinking is associated with certain science or standard proce@@ du@@ res .
People with this type of thinking have log@@ ical thinking , are able to mem@@ or@@ ize patter@@ ns , sol@@ ve problems and work on scientific tests .
Hum@@ ans are by far the most tal@@ ented species in reading the min@@ ds of others .
That means we are able to successfully pre@@ dict what other humans per@@ ce@@ ive , int@@ end , believe , know or des@@ ire .
Among these abilities , understanding the int@@ ention of others is cr@@ uc@@ ial . It allows us to resol@@ ve possible amb@@ ig@@ u@@ ities of physical actions .
For example , if you were to see someone breaking a car window , you would probably as@@ su@@ me he was trying to ste@@ al a str@@ ang@@ er &apos;s car .
He would need to be jud@@ ged differ@@ ently if he had lost his car ke@@ ys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into .
M@@ R@@ I is based on a phys@@ ics phen@@ om@@ en@@ on called nuclear mag@@ ne@@ tic res@@ on@@ ance ( N@@ M@@ R ) , which was discovered in the 193@@ 0s by F@@ eli@@ x B@@ loc@@ h ( working at Stan@@ ford University ) and Edward Pur@@ cell ( from Har@@ v@@ ard University ) .
In this res@@ on@@ ance , mag@@ ne@@ tic field and radio w@@ aves cause at@@ oms to give off tin@@ y radio sign@@ als .
In the year 1970 , R@@ ay@@ mon@@ d Dam@@ adi@@ an , a medical doctor and research scienti@@ st , discovered the basis for using mag@@ ne@@ tic res@@ on@@ ance imag@@ ing as a t@@ ool for medical diagnosis .
Four years later a pat@@ ent was granted , which was the world &apos;s first pat@@ ent issued in the field of M@@ R@@ I .
In 1977 , Dr. Dam@@ adi@@ an completed the construction of the first &quot; wh@@ ol@@ e-@@ body &quot; M@@ R@@ I sc@@ anner , which he called the &quot; In@@ dom@@ itable . &quot;
A@@ syn@@ chron@@ ous communication encour@@ ages time for refl@@ ection and reaction to others .
It allows students the ability to work at their own p@@ ace and control the p@@ ace of instruc@@ tional information .
In addition , there are fewer time restric@@ tions with the pos@@ sibility of fle@@ x@@ ible working hours . ( B@@ rem@@ er , 1998 )
The use of the Internet and the World W@@ ide We@@ b allows lear@@ ners to have access to information at all times .
Stud@@ ents can also sub@@ mit questions to instruc@@ tors at any time of day and exp@@ ect reas@@ on@@ ably qu@@ ick respon@@ ses , rather than wa@@ iting until the next fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face meeting .
The post@@ modern approach to learning offers the freedom from ab@@ sol@@ utes . There is no one good way to learn .
In fact , there is not one good thing to lear@@ n@@ .@@ L@@ earning takes place in the experience between the lear@@ ner and the knowledge presented .
Our current experience with all the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself and information pres@@ enting , lear@@ n@@ ing@@ -based television shows ill@@ u@@ str@@ ates this point .
So many of us find our@@ selves wat@@ ching a television show that in@@ forms us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge .
We will never over@@ ha@@ ul a car , build a foun@@ tain in our back@@ yard , travel to Per@@ u to exam@@ ine ancient ruins , or re@@ model our neigh@@ b@@ our &apos;s house .
Th@@ an@@ ks to under@@ sea fi@@ ber op@@ tic c@@ able lin@@ ks to Europe and broad@@ band sat@@ ell@@ ite , Gre@@ en@@ land is well connected with 9@@ 3 % of the population having internet access .
Your hotel or hosts ( if st@@ aying in a gu@@ es@@ th@@ ouse or private home ) will likely have w@@ if@@ i or an internet connected P@@ C , and all settl@@ ements have an internet c@@ af@@ e or some location with public w@@ if@@ i .
As mentioned above , though the word &quot; E@@ sk@@ im@@ o &quot; remains accep@@ table in the United States , it is considered pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative by many non-@@ U.S. Ar@@ c@@ tic pe@@ o@@ ples , especially in Canada .
While you may hear the word used by Gre@@ en@@ l@@ an@@ dic N@@ atives , its use should be av@@ o@@ ided by fore@@ ig@@ ners .
The native inhabitants of Gre@@ en@@ land call themselves In@@ u@@ it in Canada and Kal@@ a@@ al@@ le@@ q ( pl@@ ural Kal@@ a@@ alli@@ t ) , a Gre@@ en@@ land@@ er , in Gre@@ en@@ land .
Cri@@ me , and ill@@ -@@ will toward fore@@ ig@@ ners in general , is virtu@@ ally unknown in Gre@@ en@@ land . Even in the towns , there are no &quot; r@@ ough areas . &quot;
C@@ old weather is perhaps the only real dang@@ er the un@@ prepared will face .
If you visit Gre@@ en@@ land during cold seasons ( consid@@ ering that the further north you go , the col@@ der it will be ) , it is essential to bring warm enough clothing .
The very long days in the summer can lead to problems getting sufficient sleep and associated health issues .
During the summer , also watch out for the Nor@@ dic mosqu@@ it@@ oes . Although they do not transm@@ it any diseases , they can be ir@@ rit@@ ating .
While San Franc@@ is@@ co &apos;s economy is linked to it being a world@@ -@@ class tourist attraction , its economy is diver@@ si@@ fied .
The largest employ@@ ment sec@@ tors are professional services , government , fin@@ ance , trade , and tourism .
Its frequ@@ ent portr@@ ay@@ al in music , films , literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its land@@ marks known throughout the world .
San Franc@@ is@@ co has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hot@@ els , restaurants , and top@@ -@@ not@@ ch con@@ vention facilities .

Trav@@ eling to Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families .
The &quot; typical &quot; visit involves flying into Or@@ land@@ o International Airport , bus@@ ing to an on-@@ site Dis@@ ney hotel , spending about a week without leaving Dis@@ ney property , and retur@@ ning home .
There are in@@ fin@@ ite vari@@ ations possible , but this remains what most people mean when they talk of &quot; going to Dis@@ ney World . &quot;

Enter@@ ing Southern Africa by car is an am@@ az@@ ing way to see all the region &apos;s beauty as well as to get to places off the normal tourist routes .
This can be done in a normal car with care@@ ful planning but a 4@@ x@@ 4 is highly advis@@ ed and many locations are only acc@@ es@@ sible with a high whe@@ el base 4@@ x@@ 4 .
Ke@@ ep in mind while planning that although Southern Africa is stable not all neighbor@@ ing countries are .

Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we , across the border from L@@ iv@@ ing@@ stone , Z@@ amb@@ ia , and near B@@ ot@@ sw@@ ana .
The town lies immediately next to the falls , and they are the major attraction , but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure see@@ kers and si@@ gh@@ t@@ se@@ ers pl@@ enty of opportunities for a longer stay .
In the rain@@ y season ( November to March ) , the water vol@@ ume will be higher and the Falls will be more dram@@ atic .
You are guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to get we@@ t if you cross the bridge or walk along the tr@@ ails win@@ ding near the Falls .
On the other hand , it is prec@@ is@@ ely because the vol@@ ume of water is so high that your view@@ ing of the actual Falls will be ob@@ sc@@ ured - by all the water !
Tom@@ b of T@@ ut@@ ank@@ ham@@ un ( K@@ V@@ 6@@ 2 ) . K@@ V@@ 6@@ 2 may be the most famous of the tom@@ bs in the Valley , the scene of How@@ ard Car@@ ter &apos;s 19@@ 22 discovery of the almost int@@ act royal bur@@ ial of the young king .
Com@@ pared to most of the other royal tom@@ bs , however , the tomb of T@@ ut@@ ank@@ ham@@ un is bar@@ ely worth visiting , being much smaller and with limited decor@@ ation .
An@@ y@@ one interested in seeing evidence of the damage to the m@@ um@@ my done during attempts to remove it from the c@@ off@@ in will be dis@@ appointed as only the head and sh@@ ould@@ ers are visible .
The f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous rich@@ es of the tomb are no longer in it , but have been removed to the Egyp@@ tian Museum in C@@ air@@ o .

Jer@@ us@@ al@@ em is the capital and largest city of Israel , though most other countries and the United Nations do not recogn@@ ize it as Israel &apos;s capital .
The ancient city in the Ju@@ de@@ an Hills has a fasc@@ in@@ ating history sp@@ anning thousands of years .
The city is holy to the three mon@@ o@@ the@@ istic religions - Jud@@ a@@ ism , Christianity and Islam , and serves as a spiritual , religious , and cultural center .
Due to the religious significance of the city , and in particular the many sites of the Old City area , Jer@@ us@@ al@@ em is one of the main tourist dest@@ inations in Israel .
Jer@@ us@@ al@@ em has many historic , arch@@ e@@ ological and cultural sites , along with vi@@ br@@ ant and crow@@ ded shopping centers , c@@ af@@ é@@ s , and restaurants .
E@@ cu@@ ador requires that Cub@@ an citizens receive an inv@@ itation letter prior to enter@@ ing E@@ cu@@ ador through international air@@ ports or fron@@ ti@@ er ad@@ mission points .
This letter must be leg@@ alized by the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or@@ ian Ministry of Fore@@ ign Aff@@ airs , and compl@@ y with certain requi@@ rements .
These requi@@ rements are designed to provide an organized migr@@ atory flow between both countries .
Cub@@ an citizens who are US green card hol@@ ders should visit an E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or@@ ian Con@@ sul@@ ate to ob@@ tain an ex@@ emp@@ tion to this requi@@ rement .
Your pas@@ sport must be val@@ id for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates . A round / on@@ ward trip tic@@ ket is needed to pro@@ ve the length of your stay .

Over 60 cru@@ ise ships ply the Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os waters - rang@@ ing in size from 8 to 100 passengers .
Most people book their place well in advance ( as the boats are usually full during the high season ) .
Be sure the agent through whom you book is a Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os speci@@ alist with a good knowledge of a wide variety of ships .
This will ensure that your particular interests and / or con@@ str@@ aints are mat@@ ched with the ship most su@@ itable to them .
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century , northern Ch@@ ile was under In@@ ca rule while the indigenous Ara@@ uc@@ an@@ ians ( M@@ apu@@ ch@@ e ) in@@ hab@@ ited central and southern Ch@@ ile .
The M@@ apu@@ ch@@ e were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups , that were not fully absor@@ bed into Sp@@ an@@ ish@@ -@@ speaking rule until after Ch@@ ile &apos;s independence .
Although Ch@@ ile declared independence in 18@@ 10 ( am@@ id the N@@ ap@@ ol@@ e@@ onic war@@ s that left Spain without a func@@ tion@@ ing central government for a couple of years ) , decis@@ ive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 18@@ 18 .

The C@@ ook Islands are an island country in free association with New Zealand , located in Pol@@ yn@@ es@@ ia , in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean .
It is an arch@@ ip@@ el@@ ago with 15 islands spread out over 2.@@ 2 million km2 of oc@@ ean .
With the same time zone as Haw@@ ai@@ i , the islands are sometimes thought of as &quot; Haw@@ ai@@ i down under . &quot;
Though smaller , it re@@ min@@ ds some el@@ der@@ ly visitors of Haw@@ ai@@ i before stat@@ e@@ hood without all the large tourist hot@@ els and other development .
The C@@ ook Islands do not have any cities but are composed of 15 different islands . The main ones are R@@ ar@@ ot@@ ong@@ a and A@@ it@@ ut@@ ak@@ i .
In developed countries today , providing del@@ u@@ x@@ e bed and break@@ f@@ asts has been raised to a s@@ ort of ar@@ t-@@ form .

Bre@@ ak@@ fast may include seas@@ onal del@@ ights of the region or the host &apos;s speci@@ ality dish .
The setting might be an historic old building with anti@@ que fur@@ n@@ ish@@ ings , man@@ ic@@ ured gr@@ ounds and a swim@@ ming pool .
G@@ et@@ ting into your own car and head@@ ing off on a long road trip has an intr@@ in@@ si@@ c appeal in its sim@@ pl@@ icity .
Unlike larger vehicles , you are probably already famili@@ ar with driving your car and know its lim@@ it@@ ations .
S@@ et@@ ting up a t@@ ent on private property or in a town of any size can easily at@@ tract un@@ wanted attention .
In short , using your car is a great way to take a road trip but sel@@ dom in itself a way to &quot; camp . &quot;
C@@ ar camp@@ ing is possible if you have a large min@@ iv@@ an , S@@ U@@ V , S@@ ed@@ an or Station W@@ ag@@ on with seats that lay down .
Some hot@@ els have a heritage from the golden age of ste@@ am rail@@ ways and oc@@ ean lin@@ ers ; before the Second World War , in the 19th or early 20th centuries .
These hot@@ els were where the rich and the famous of the day would stay , and often had fine din@@ ing and n@@ ight@@ life .
The old fashi@@ oned f@@ itt@@ ings , the lack of the latest am@@ en@@ ities , and a certain gr@@ ac@@ eful ag@@ ed@@ ness are also part of their character .
While they are usually priv@@ ately owned , they sometimes accommod@@ ate visiting heads of state and other di@@ gn@@ it@@ aries .
A trav@@ eller with pil@@ es of money might consider a round the world flight , broken up with st@@ ays in many of these hot@@ els .
A hosp@@ it@@ ality exchange network is the organization that conn@@ ects travel@@ ers with loc@@ als in the cities they are going to visit .
Jo@@ ining such a network usually just requires f@@ illing out an online form ; although some net@@ works offer or require additional ver@@ ification .
A li@@ sting of available hosts is then provided either in print and / or online , sometimes with refer@@ ences and reviews by other travel@@ ers .
C@@ ou@@ ch@@ sur@@ f@@ ing was founded in January 2004 after computer programm@@ er C@@ as@@ ey F@@ ent@@ on found a che@@ ap flight to I@@ cel@@ and but did not have a place to stay .
He em@@ ailed students at the local university and received an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming number of offers for free accommod@@ ation .
H@@ o@@ st@@ els c@@ ater primarily to young people - a typical gu@@ est is in their tw@@ enti@@ es - but you can often find older trav@@ ell@@ ers there too .
Fam@@ il@@ ies with children are a rare sight , but some ho@@ st@@ els do allow them in private rooms .
The city of Be@@ ij@@ ing in China will be the host city of the Olympic Winter Games in 2022 , which will make it the first city to have hosted both the summer and winter Olympics .
Be@@ ij@@ ing will host the opening and clos@@ ing ceremon@@ ies and the ind@@ oor ice events .
Other sk@@ i@@ ing events will be at the T@@ a@@ iz@@ ich@@ en@@ g ski area in Z@@ hang@@ j@@ i@@ ak@@ ou , about 2@@ 20 km ( 1@@ 40 miles ) from Be@@ ij@@ ing .
Most of the temples do have an Ann@@ ual festival starting from November end to M@@ id of May , which v@@ aries according to each temple &apos;s annual calendar .
Most of the temple festivals is celebrated as part of temple &apos;s anniversary or presid@@ ing deity &apos;s birthday or any other major event associated with the temple .
Kerala &apos;s temple festivals are very interesting to see , with regular proc@@ ession of decorated elephants , temple or@@ che@@ stra and other festiv@@ ities .
A World &apos;s F@@ air ( commonly called World Ex@@ position , or simply Ex@@ p@@ o ) is large international festival of arts and sci@@ ences .
Par@@ tic@@ ip@@ ating countries present arti@@ stic and educational dis@@ plays in national p@@ av@@ il@@ ions to sh@@ ow@@ case world issues or their country &apos;s culture and history .
International Hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural Ex@@ positions are speci@@ alised events which sh@@ ow@@ case fl@@ oral dis@@ plays , bot@@ an@@ ical gardens and anything else to do with plants .
Although in theory they can take place annually ( so long as they are in different countries ) , in practice they are not .
These events normally last any@@ where between three and six months , and are held on sites no smaller than 50 h@@ ec@@ tar@@ es .
There are many different film form@@ ats that have been used over the years . St@@ and@@ ard 35 mm film ( 36 by 24 mm negative ) is much the common@@ est .
It can usually be repl@@ en@@ ished fair@@ ly easily if you run out , and gives resol@@ ution r@@ oughly compar@@ able to a current D@@ S@@ L@@ R .
Some medi@@ um@@ -@@ form@@ at film cam@@ er@@ as use a 6 by 6 c@@ m form@@ at , more prec@@ is@@ ely a 56 by 56 mm negative .
This gives resol@@ ution almost four times that of a 35 mm negative ( 3@@ 13@@ 6 m@@ m@@ 2 ver@@ sus 8@@ 64 ) .
Wil@@ dlife is among the most challeng@@ ing mo@@ ti@@ f@@ s for a phot@@ ograp@@ her , and needs a combination of good l@@ uck , pati@@ ence , experience and good equipment .
Wil@@ dlife phot@@ ography is often taken for granted , but like phot@@ ography in general , a picture is worth a thousand words .
Wil@@ dlife phot@@ ography often requires a long t@@ el@@ ep@@ ho@@ to l@@ ens , though things like a fl@@ ock of birds or a tin@@ y cre@@ ature need other l@@ en@@ ses .
Many ex@@ otic animals are hard to find , and parks sometimes have rules about taking phot@@ ograph@@ s for commercial purposes .
Wil@@ d animals might either be sh@@ y or agg@@ ressive . The environment might be cold , hot , or otherwise h@@ os@@ tile .
The world has over 5,000 different languages , including more than tw@@ enty with 50 million or more speakers .
W@@ rit@@ ten words are often easier to understand than spoken words , also . This is especially true of add@@ resses , which are often difficult to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce int@@ el@@ li@@ gi@@ b@@ ly .
Many entire nations are completely flu@@ ent in English , and in even more you can exp@@ ect a limited knowledge - especially among younger people .

There are many things you have to take into consid@@ eration before and when you travel some@@ where .
When you travel , exp@@ ect things not to be like they are &quot; back home . &quot; M@@ ann@@ ers , laws , food , traffic , l@@ od@@ ging , standards , language and so on will to some extent diff@@ er from where you live .
This is something you always need to keep in mind , to avoid dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment or perhaps even dist@@ aste over local ways to do things .
Travel ag@@ encies have been around since the 19th century . A travel agent is usually a good option for a journey which ext@@ ends beyond a trav@@ eller &apos;s previous experience of nature , culture , language or low-@@ income countries .
Although most ag@@ encies are w@@ illing to take on most regular boo@@ kings , many ag@@ ents speci@@ al@@ ise in particular types of travel , budget ranges or dest@@ inations .
It can be better to use an agent who frequently books similar tri@@ ps to y@@ ours .

If you want to see the world on the che@@ ap , for necess@@ ity , life@@ style or challenge , there are some ways to do that .
Bas@@ ically , they fall into two categories : E@@ ither work while you travel or try and limit your expenses . This article is focused on the latter .

An im@@ migr@@ ation chec@@ k@@ point is usually the first stop when dis@@ emb@@ ar@@ king from a plane , a ship , or another vehicle .
In some cros@@ s-@@ border trains in@@ spec@@ tions are done on the running train and you should have val@@ id I@@ D with you when bo@@ ar@@ ding one of those trains .
On night sle@@ ep@@ er trains , pas@@ sports may be collected by the conduc@@ tor so that you do not have your sleep inter@@ rup@@ ted .
Regi@@ str@@ ation is an additional requi@@ rement for the vis@@ a process . In some countries , you must regi@@ ster your presence and address where you are st@@ aying with the local authorities .
This might require f@@ illing out a form with the local police or a visit to the im@@ migr@@ ation offices .
In many countries with such a law , local hot@@ els will hand@@ le the regi@@ str@@ ation ( make sure to ask ) .
In other cases , only those st@@ aying outside of tourist accommod@@ ations need to regi@@ ster . However , this makes the law much more ob@@ sc@@ ure , so find out be@@ fore@@ hand .
Arch@@ it@@ ecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings . The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in its own right .
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or from a cl@@ ever@@ ly@@ -@@ positi@@ oned window can be a beauty to be@@ hold .
Arch@@ it@@ ecture over@@ l@@ aps consid@@ er@@ ably with other fields including urban planning , civil engineering , decor@@ ative arts , inter@@ ior design and landsc@@ ape design .
G@@ iv@@ en how remote many of the pu@@ e@@ bl@@ os are , you won &apos;t be able to find a significant amount of n@@ ight@@ life without trav@@ eling to Al@@ bu@@ qu@@ er@@ que or S@@ anta F@@ e .

However , n@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays there are established gr@@ aff@@ iti artists , gr@@ aff@@ iti events and &quot; legal &quot; walls . G@@ ra@@ ff@@ iti paintings in this cont@@ ext often res@@ em@@ ble art@@ works rather than il@@ le@@ gi@@ ble t@@ ags .
Bo@@ om@@ er@@ ang th@@ rowing is a popular sk@@ ill that many tourists want to acqu@@ ire .

M@@ etro@@ Ra@@ il has two classes on comm@@ u@@ ter trains in and around C@@ ape T@@ own : M@@ etro@@ Pl@@ us ( also called First Cl@@ ass ) and Me@@ tro ( called Thir@@ d Cl@@ ass ) .
M@@ etro@@ Pl@@ us is more comfortable and less crow@@ ded but slightly more expensive , though still che@@ aper than normal me@@ tro tic@@ kets in Europe .
Every train has both M@@ etro@@ Pl@@ us and Me@@ tro co@@ aches ; the M@@ etro@@ Pl@@ us co@@ aches are always on the end of the train nearest C@@ ape T@@ own .
Car@@ rying for others - N@@ ever let your b@@ ags out of your sight , especially when you are cros@@ sing international borders .
You could find yourself being used as a drug car@@ rier without your knowledge , which will land you in a great deal of trou@@ ble .
This includes wa@@ iting in line , as dru@@ g@@ -@@ sn@@ i@@ ff@@ ing d@@ ogs could be used at any time without notice .
Some countries have exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian pun@@ ish@@ ments even for first time off@@ en@@ ses ; these can include prison sent@@ ences of over 10 years or death .
Un@@ attended b@@ ags are a target for the@@ ft and can also at@@ tract attention from authorities w@@ ary of b@@ om@@ b thre@@ ats .
At home , due to this const@@ ant exposure to the local g@@ er@@ ms , od@@ ds are very high that you &apos;re already immune to them .
But in other parts of the world , where the bacter@@ i@@ ological fa@@ una are new to you , you &apos;re far more likely to run into problems .
Also , in war@@ mer clim@@ ates bacteria both grow more quickly and sur@@ vive longer outside the body .

If trav@@ eling in a developing country for the first time - or in a new part of the world - don &apos;t under@@ estim@@ ate the potential culture sh@@ ock .
Many a stable , cap@@ able travel@@ er has been over@@ come by the new@@ ness of developing world travel , where many little cultural ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments can add up quickly .
E@@ spec@@ ially in your initial days , consider spl@@ ur@@ ging on West@@ ern@@ -@@ style and -@@ quality hot@@ els , food , and services to help acc@@ lim@@ ati@@ ze .
Do not sleep on a m@@ att@@ ress or p@@ ad on the ground in areas where you do not know the local fa@@ una .
If you are going to camp out , bring a camp co@@ t or h@@ amm@@ ock to keep you away from sn@@ akes , sc@@ or@@ p@@ ions and such .
F@@ ill your home with a rich coffee in the morning and some rela@@ xing ch@@ am@@ om@@ ile tea at night .
When you &apos;re on a st@@ ay@@ c@@ ation , you have the time to treat yourself and take a few extra minutes to bre@@ w up something special .
If you &apos;re feeling more adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous , take the opportunity to ju@@ ice or bl@@ end up some sm@@ ooth@@ ies :

If you live in a city with a vari@@ ed drinking culture , go to b@@ ars or pub@@ s in neighbor@@ h@@ oods you don &apos;t frequ@@ ent .
For those un@@ famili@@ ar with medical jar@@ g@@ on , the words inf@@ ectious and cont@@ ag@@ ious have distinct mean@@ ings .
An inf@@ ectious disease is one that is caused by a path@@ og@@ en , such as a virus , bacter@@ ium , fun@@ g@@ us or other par@@ as@@ ites .
A cont@@ ag@@ ious disease is a disease which is easily transm@@ itted by being in the vic@@ inity of an infected person .
Many governments require visitors enter@@ ing , or residents leaving , their countries to be vacc@@ inated for a range of diseases .
These requi@@ rements may often dep@@ end on what countries a trav@@ eller has visited or int@@ ends to visit .
One of strong points of Char@@ l@@ ot@@ te , North Carolina , is that it has an ab@@ un@@ dance of high-@@ quality options for families .
Res@@ idents from other areas often c@@ ite famil@@ y-@@ friend@@ lin@@ ess as a primary reason for moving there , and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children around .
In the past 20 years , the amount of chil@@ d-@@ friendly options in Up@@ town Char@@ l@@ ot@@ te has grown exp@@ on@@ entially .
T@@ ax@@ is are not generally used by families in Char@@ l@@ ot@@ te , though they can be of some use in certain circumstances .
There is a sur@@ charge for having more than 2 passengers , so this option might be more expensive than necessary .
An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a is the col@@ d@@ est place on Earth , and surr@@ ounds the South Pol@@ e .
Tou@@ ri@@ st vis@@ its are co@@ stly , demand physical f@@ it@@ ness , can only take place in summer Nov@@ -@@ Fe@@ b , and are largely limited to the Pen@@ insul@@ a , Islands and Ros@@ s Sea .
A couple of thousand staff live here in summer in some four do@@ zen b@@ ases mostly in those areas ; a small number stay over winter .
In@@ land An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a is a des@@ ol@@ ate pl@@ ateau covered by 2-@@ 3 km of ice .
Oc@@ cas@@ ional speci@@ alist air tours go in@@ land , for moun@@ tain@@ e@@ ering or to reach the Pol@@ e , which has a large base .
The South Pol@@ e Tr@@ aver@@ se ( or Highway ) is a 16@@ 00 km tra@@ il from Mc@@ Mur@@ do Station on the Ros@@ s Sea to the Pol@@ e .
It &apos;s comp@@ acted snow with cre@@ v@@ asses filled in and marked by fl@@ ags . It can only be travel@@ ed by speci@@ alized trac@@ tors , ha@@ ul@@ ing sle@@ ds with fu@@ el and suppl@@ ies .
These ar@@ en &apos;t very n@@ im@@ ble so the tra@@ il has to take a long sw@@ erve around the Tran@@ s@@ ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic Moun@@ tains to come onto the pl@@ ateau .
The most common cause for acc@@ idents in winter is sli@@ p@@ per@@ y roads , p@@ av@@ ements ( si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks ) and especially steps .
At a minimum , you need foot@@ wear with su@@ itable sol@@ es . Summer sho@@ es are usually very sli@@ p@@ per@@ y on ice and snow , even some winter boo@@ ts are defic@@ ient .
The patter@@ n should be deep enough , 5 mm ( 1 / 5 in@@ ch ) or more , and the material sof@@ t enough in cold temperatures .
Some boo@@ ts have stu@@ ds and there is stud@@ ded add@@ -@@ on equipment for sli@@ p@@ per@@ y conditions , su@@ itable for most sho@@ es and boo@@ ts , for the he@@ els or he@@ els and sol@@ e .
He@@ els should be low and wide . S@@ and , grav@@ el or salt ( cal@@ c@@ ium ch@@ lor@@ ide ) is often sc@@ at@@ tered on roads or p@@ aths to improve trac@@ tion .
A@@ val@@ an@@ ches are not an ab@@ norm@@ ality ; ste@@ ep sl@@ opes can hold only so much slow , and the exc@@ ess vol@@ um@@ es will come down as av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
The problem is that snow is stic@@ ky , so it needs some trigg@@ ering to come down , and some snow coming down can be the trigg@@ ering event for the rest .
Sometimes the original trigg@@ ing event is the sun war@@ ming the snow , sometimes some more snow@@ fall , sometimes other natural events , often a human .
A tor@@ n@@ ado is a sp@@ inning col@@ um@@ n of very low-@@ pressure air , which suc@@ ks the surrounding air in@@ ward and up@@ ward .
They gener@@ ate high winds ( often 10@@ 0-@@ 200 miles / hour ) and can lif@@ t heavy objects into the air , car@@ rying them as the tor@@ n@@ ado moves .
They begin as fun@@ n@@ els desc@@ ending from storm cl@@ ou@@ ds , and become &quot; tor@@ n@@ ad@@ oes &quot; when they touch the ground .
Per@@ s@@ onal V@@ P@@ N ( vir@@ tual private network ) prov@@ id@@ ers are an excellent way of circum@@ v@@ enting both political cen@@ sor@@ ship and commercial I@@ P@@ -@@ ge@@ o@@ fil@@ ter@@ ing .
They are su@@ peri@@ or to web pro@@ x@@ ies for several reasons : They re-@@ route all Internet traffic , not only h@@ tt@@ p .
They normally offer higher b@@ and@@ wid@@ th and better quality of service . They are enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted and thus har@@ der to sp@@ y on .
The media companies rout@@ in@@ ely lie about the purpose of this , claim@@ ing that it is to &quot; prevent p@@ ir@@ acy . &quot;
In fact , region c@@ odes have ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely no effect on illegal cop@@ ying ; a b@@ it@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ bit copy of a dis@@ k will play just fine on any device where the original will .
The actual purpose is to give those companies more control over their mar@@ kets ; it &apos;s all about money sp@@ inning .
Because calls are r@@ ou@@ ted over the Internet , you do not need to use a phone company located where you live or where you travel .
There is also no requi@@ rement that you ob@@ tain a local number from the community in which you live ; you can ob@@ tain a sat@@ ell@@ ite Internet connection in the wil@@ ds of Ch@@ ick@@ en , Al@@ as@@ ka and sel@@ ect a number which claims you &apos;re in sun@@ ny Ari@@ z@@ ona .
Often , you have to buy a global number separ@@ ately that allows P@@ S@@ T@@ N ph@@ ones to call you . Wh@@ ere the number is from makes a difference for people call@@ ing you .
Re@@ al-@@ time text transl@@ ator app@@ s - appl@@ ications that are cap@@ able of autom@@ atically transl@@ ating whole se@@ g@@ ments of text from one language into another .
Some of the appl@@ ications in this category can even transl@@ ate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smar@@ t@@ phone towards those objects .
The transl@@ ation eng@@ ines have im@@ proved dram@@ atically , and now often give more or less correct transl@@ ations ( and more sel@@ dom gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish ) , but some care is due , as they still may have g@@ ot@@ ten it all wrong .
One of the most prominent app@@ s in this category is Google Tran@@ sl@@ ate , which allows off@@ line transl@@ ation after down@@ lo@@ ading the des@@ ired language data .
U@@ sing G@@ P@@ S nav@@ ig@@ ation app@@ s on your smar@@ t@@ phone can be the eas@@ iest and most conven@@ ient way to nav@@ ig@@ ate when out of your home country .
It can save money over buying new m@@ aps for a G@@ P@@ S , or a stand@@ alone G@@ P@@ S device or r@@ enting one from a car r@@ ental company .
If you don &apos;t have a data connection for your phone , or when it is out of range , their performance can be limited or un@@ available .
Every corner store is filled with a conf@@ using arr@@ ay of pre-@@ paid phone cards that can be used from pay ph@@ ones or ordinary t@@ eleph@@ ones .
While most cards are good for call@@ ing any@@ where , some speci@@ al@@ ise in providing fav@@ our@@ able call rates to specific groups of countries .
Ac@@ c@@ ess to these services is often through a t@@ oll@@ -@@ free t@@ eleph@@ one number that can be called from most ph@@ ones without charge .
R@@ ul@@ es regarding regular phot@@ ography also apply to video recor@@ ding , possibly even more so .
If just taking a photo of something is@@ n &apos;t allowed , then you sh@@ ould@@ n &apos;t even think of recor@@ ding a video of it .
If using a dr@@ one , check well in advance as to what you are allowed to film and what per@@ m@@ its or additional lic@@ en@@ sing are required .
F@@ lying a dr@@ one near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea , even if it &apos;s not illegal in your area .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays air travel is only rar@@ ely boo@@ ked directly through the air@@ line without first search@@ ing and compar@@ ing prices .
Sometimes the same flight can have v@@ ast@@ ly differ@@ ing prices at various ag@@ reg@@ ators and it p@@ ays to comp@@ are search results and to also look at the website of the air@@ line itself before boo@@ king .
In general , st@@ aying in any foreign country for an extended period of time will require you to ob@@ tain a vis@@ a in advance .
Stud@@ ent vis@@ as generally have different requi@@ rements and application proce@@ du@@ res from normal tourist or business vis@@ as .
For most countries , you will need an offer letter from the in@@ stitution you wish to study at , and also evidence of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course .
Ch@@ eck with the in@@ stitution , as well as the im@@ migr@@ ation department for the country you wish to study in for det@@ ailed requi@@ rements .
Un@@ less you are a dipl@@ om@@ at , working overseas generally means that you will have to file income tax in the country you are based in .
In@@ come tax is struc@@ tured differ@@ ently in different countries , and the tax rates and br@@ ac@@ kets vary widely from one country to another .
In some federal countries , such as the United States and Canada , income tax is lev@@ ied both at the federal level and at the local level , so the rates and br@@ ac@@ kets can vary from region to region .
While im@@ migr@@ ation check is usually ab@@ sent or a form@@ ality when you ar@@ rive in your hom@@ el@@ and , custom@@ s control can be a h@@ ass@@ le .
Make sure you know what you can and cannot bring in and dec@@ l@@ are anything over the legal lim@@ its .
The eas@@ iest way to get started in the business of travel writing is to h@@ one your skills on an established travel bl@@ og website .
After you become comfortable with form@@ at@@ ting and ed@@ iting on the web , then later , you might create your own website .
Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering while trav@@ elling is a great way to make a difference but it &apos;s not just about giving .
L@@ iving and volun@@ te@@ ering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture , meet new people , learn about yourself , get a sense of per@@ spec@@ tive and even gain new skills .
It can also be a good way to stret@@ ch a budget to allow a longer stay some@@ where since many volun@@ te@@ er jobs provide room and board and a few pay a small sal@@ ary .
Vik@@ ings used the Russian water@@ ways to get to the Black Sea and C@@ asp@@ ian Sea . Par@@ ts of these routes can still be used . Ch@@ eck possible need for special per@@ m@@ its , which may be difficult to get .
The White Se@@ a-@@ Bal@@ tic Can@@ al conn@@ ects the Ar@@ c@@ tic Ocean to the Bal@@ tic Sea , via Lake O@@ ne@@ ga , Lake Lad@@ oga and S@@ aint Pe@@ ter@@ s@@ burg , mostly by rivers and lakes .
Lake O@@ ne@@ ga is also connected to Vol@@ ga , so coming from the C@@ asp@@ ian Sea through Russia is still possible .
Be ass@@ ured that once you hit the mar@@ in@@ as everything will be pre@@ t@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous . You will meet other boat h@@ itch@@ hi@@ kers and they will share their information with you .
Bas@@ ically you &apos;ll be putting up notic@@ es offering your help , pac@@ ing the doc@@ ks , appro@@ aching people clean@@ ing their y@@ ach@@ ts , trying to make contact with sa@@ il@@ ors in the bar , etc .
T@@ ry to talk to as many people as possible . After a while everyone will know you and will give you hin@@ ts as to which boat is looking for someone .
You should choose your F@@ requ@@ ent F@@ ly@@ er air@@ line in an alli@@ ance care@@ fully .
Airlines such as Em@@ ir@@ ates , E@@ ti@@ had Air@@ ways , Q@@ at@@ ar Air@@ ways &amp; Turk@@ ish Airlines have great@@ ly expanded their services to Africa , and offer conn@@ ections to many major African cities at competi@@ tive rates than other European air@@ lines .
Turk@@ ish Airlines f@@ lies to 39 dest@@ inations in 30 African countries as of 2014 .
If you have additional travel time , check to see how your total fare quot@@ e to Africa compar@@ es with a r@@ ound@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ world fare .
Don &apos;t for@@ get to add in the extra costs of additional vis@@ as , de@@ par@@ ture taxes , ground transportation , etc. for all those places outside of Africa .
If you want to fly around the world completely in the Southern H@@ em@@ is@@ phere , the choice of flights and dest@@ inations is limited due to the lack of trans@@ oc@@ e@@ an@@ ic routes .
No air@@ line alli@@ ance covers all three oc@@ ean cros@@ s@@ ings in the Southern H@@ em@@ is@@ phere ( and Sk@@ y@@ Te@@ am covers n@@ one of the cros@@ s@@ ings ) .
However , Star Al@@ li@@ ance covers everything except the eastern South Pacific from S@@ anti@@ ago de Ch@@ ile to T@@ ah@@ iti , which is a L@@ AT@@ A@@ M O@@ ne@@ world flight .
This flight is not the only option if you want to sk@@ ip the South Pacific and the west coast of South America . ( see below )

Over the centuries , people have care@@ fully built ter@@ races on the ru@@ gg@@ ed , ste@@ ep landsc@@ ape right up to the cli@@ ff@@ s that over@@ look the sea .
Par@@ t of its char@@ m is the lack of visible corpor@@ ate development . P@@ aths , trains and boats connect the villages , and cars cannot reach them from the outside .
The varieties of French which are spoken in Belgi@@ um and Switzerland diff@@ er slightly from the French spoken in France , though they are similar enough to be mut@@ ually int@@ el@@ li@@ gi@@ ble .
In particular , the num@@ ber@@ ing system in Fr@@ en@@ ch@@ -@@ speaking Belgi@@ um and Switzerland has some s@@ light p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ ities that are different from the French spoken in France , and the pr@@ on@@ unc@@ i@@ ation of some words is slightly different .
